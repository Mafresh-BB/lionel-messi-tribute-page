                    <dt>2003-2005: Rise to the first team</dt>
                    <dd>During the 2003–04 season, his fourth with Barcelona, Messi rapidly progressed through the
                        club's ranks, debuting for a record five youth teams in a single campaign.[30] After being named
                        player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the Juveniles B, he
                        played only one official match with the team before being promoted to the Juveniles A, where he
                        scored 18 goals in 11 league games.[31][32] Messi was then one of several youth players called
                        up to strengthen a depleted first team during the international break. French winger Ludovic
                        Giuly explained how Messi caught the eye in a training session with Frank Rijkaard's first team:
                        "He destroyed us all... They were kicking him all over the place to avoid being ridiculed by
                        this kid, he just got up and kept on playing. He would dribble past four players and score a
                        goal. Even the team's starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an alien."[33]

                    <dt>2005–2008: Becoming a starting eleven player</dt>
                    <dd>
                        On 24 June, his 18th birthday, Messi signed his first contract as a senior team player. It made
                        him a Barcelona player until 2010, two years less than his previous contract, but his buyout
                        clause increased to €150 million.[40] His breakthrough came two months later, on 24 August,
                        during the Joan Gamper Trophy, Barcelona's pre-season competition. A starter for the first time,
                        he gave a well-received performance against Fabio Capello's Juventus, receiving an ovation from
                        the Camp Nou.[47] Capello sought to take Messi to Juventus on loan, but Inter Milan offered to
                        pay his €150 million buyout clause and triple his wages.[48] According to then-president Joan
                        Laporta, it was the only time the club faced a real risk of losing Messi, but he ultimately
                        decided to stay.[49] On 16 September, his contract was updated for the second time in three
                        months and extended to 2014.

                    <dt>2008–09: First treble</dt>
                    <dd>
                        After two unsuccessful seasons, Barcelona were in need of an overhaul, leading to the departure
                        of Rijkaard and Ronaldinho. Upon the latter's departure, Messi was given the number 10
                        shirt.[53] He signed a new contract in July with an annual salary of €7.8 million, becoming the
                        club's highest-paid player.[79][80] Ahead of the new season, a major concern remained his
                        frequent muscular injuries, which had left him side-lined for a total of eight months between
                        2006 and 2008. To combat the problem, the club implemented new training, nutrition, and
                        lifestyle regimens, and assigned him a personal physiotherapist, who would travel with him
                        during call-ups for the Argentina national team. As a result, Messi remained virtually
                        injury-free during the next four years, allowing him to reach his full potential.[62][81]
                        Despite his injuries early in the year, his performances in 2008 saw him again voted runner-up
                        for the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times behind Cristiano
                        Ronaldo

                    <dd>
                        His team's prosperity continued into the second half of 2009, as Barcelona became the first club
                        to achieve the sextuple, winning six top-tier trophies in a single year.[91] After victories in
                        the Supercopa de España and UEFA Super Cup in August, Barcelona won the FIFA Club World Cup
                        against Estudiantes de La Plata on 19 December, with Messi scoring the winning 2–1 goal with his
                        chest.[92] At 22 years old, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year
                        award, both times by the biggest voting margin in each trophy's history.

                    <dd>
                        Messi secured Barcelona's first trophy of the 2010–11 campaign, the Supercopa de España, by
                        scoring a hat-trick in his side's second-leg 4–0 victory over Sevilla, after a first-leg
                        defeat.[101] Assuming a playmaking role, he was again instrumental in a Clásico on 29 November
                        2010, the first with José Mourinho in charge of Real Madrid, as Barcelona defeated their rivals
                        5–0.[102] Messi helped the team achieve 16 consecutive league victories, a record in Spanish
                        football, concluding with another hat-trick against Atlético Madrid on 5 February
                        2011.[103][104] His club performances in 2010 earned him the inaugural FIFA Ballon d'Or, an
                        amalgamation of the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, though his win was
                        met with some criticism due to his lack of success with Argentina at the 2010 FIFA World
                        Cup.[73][105] Under the award's old format, he would have placed just outside the top three,
                        owing his win to the votes from the international coaches and captains.

                    <dt>2012: A record-breaking year</dt>
                    <dd>
                        As Messi maintained his goalscoring form into the second half of the season, the year 2012 saw
                        him break several longstanding records. On 7 March, two weeks after scoring four goals in a
                        league fixture against Valencia, he scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match
                        against Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the
                        competition.[124][125] In addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists,
                        this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals, tying José Altafini's record from the 1962–63
                        season, as well as becoming only the second player after Gerd Müller to be top scorer in four
                        campaigns.[126][127] Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in
                        Barcelona's history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of César Rodríguez's 232
                        goals with a hat-trick against Granada.[128]

                    <dt>2020–21: Final season at Barcelona</dt>
                    <dd>
                        On 27 September, Messi began the 2020–21 season by scoring a penalty in a 4–0 home win against
                        Villarreal in La Liga.[296] Two days prior to the opening game, he again criticised the club,
                        this time for the manner of Luis Suárez's departure, stating, "at this stage nothing surprises
                        me any more".[297] On 20 October, Messi scored a penalty in a 5–1 home victory against
                        Ferencváros in the Champions League, becoming the first player in history to score in sixteen
                        consecutive Champions League seasons.[298] On 25 November, Messi was nominated for the 2020 Best
                        FIFA Men's Player award, and was later shortlisted as one of the final three
                        candidates.[299][300] On 29 November, Messi scored his side's fourth goal in their 4–0 victory
                        over Osasuna. After scoring, he unveiled a shirt of his former side Newell's Old Boys, in
                        tribute to Argentine compatriot Diego Maradona, who had died four days earlier, and raised both
                        hands to the screen showing Maradona's face in the stadium. The shirt was a number 10 replica of
                        the same one Maradona had worn during his stint with the club in 1993.[301] On 17 December,
                        Messi finished third in The Best FIFA Men's Player award behind Robert Lewandowski and Cristiano
                        Ronaldo, and was included in the FIFA FIFPro World XI for the fourteenth consecutive year.

                    <dd>
                        On 10 August, Messi joined French club Paris Saint-Germain.[321] He signed a two-year deal until
                        June 2023 with an option for an extra year.[322] Messi chose 30 as his squad number, the same he
                        wore as a teenager when he made his senior debut for Barcelona.[323]

                        Messi made his debut for the club on 29 August, coming on as a substitute in the second half of
                        a 2–0 away win over Reims in Ligue 1.[324] He made his first start and Champions League debut
                        for the club in a 1–1 away draw against Club Brugge on 15 September.[325] Four days later, Messi
                        made his home debut for PSG in a 2–1 win over Lyon.[326] On 28 September, he scored his first
                        goal for the club, a strike from the edge of the 18-yard box in a 2–0 Champions League group
                        stage win over Pep Guardiola's Manchester City.[327] On 21 November, Messi scored his first
                        Ligue 1 goal in a 3–1 home victory over Nantes.[328] Later that month, he provided a hat-trick
                        of assists for the fifth time in his career as PSG beat Saint-Étienne 3–1 away from home.[329]
                        Having scored 40 goals at club and international level for the calendar year and helped
                        Argentina win the 2021 Copa América, Messi received a record seventh Ballon d'Or on 29 November.

                        After adjusting to his new surroundings and settling in Paris, under new coach Christophe
                        Galtier, Messi returned to his preferred free attacking role; being placed in his favoured
                        position as the playmaker behind two strikers, in a attacking trident with Neymar and Kylian
                        Mbappé, quickly regaining his form from his previous season by starting off the new season on 31
                        July by scoring PSG's first goal in a 4–0 victory over Nantes in the Trophée des Champions,
                        winning his second trophy with PSG.[341]

                <dd>
                    On 14 June 2021, Messi scored from a free kick in a 1–1 draw against Chile in Argentina's opening
                    group match of the 2021 Copa América in Brazil.[468] On 21 June, Messi played in his 147th match as
                    he equalled Javier Mascherano's record for most appearances for Argentina in a 1–0 win over Paraguay
                    in their third game of the tournament.[469] A week later, he broke the record for most appearances
                    in an Argentina shirt when he featured in a 4–1 win against Bolivia in his team's final group match,
                    assisting Papu Gómez's opening goal and later scoring two.[470] On 3 July, Messi assisted twice and
                    scored from a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Ecuador in the quarter-finals of the competition.[471] On
                    6 July, in a 1–1 draw in the semi-finals against Colombia, Messi made his 150th appearance for his
                    country and registered his fifth assist of the tournament, a cut-back for Lautaro Martínez, matching
                    his record of nine goal contributions in a single tournament from five years earlier; he later
                    netted his spot kick in Argentina's eventual 3–2 penalty shoot-out victory to progress to his fifth
                    international final.[472][473] On 10 July, Argentina defeated hosts Brazil 1–0 in the final, giving
                    Messi his first major international title and Argentina's first since 1993, as well as his nation's
                    joint record 15th Copa América overall.[474][475] Messi was directly involved in 9 out of the 12
                    goals scored by Argentina, scoring four and assisting five; he was named the player of the
                    tournament for his performances, an honour he shared with Neymar. He also finished as the
                    tournament's top scorer with four goals tied with Colombia's Luis Díaz, with the Golden Boot awarded
                    to Messi as he had more assists.[476][477]


                    Messi at the 2022 FIFA World Cup
                    On 9 September, Messi scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 home win over Bolivia in a 2022 World Cup
                    qualifier which also moved him above Pelé as South America's top male international scorer with 79
                    goals.[478] In the 2022 Finalissima, the third edition of the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions, at
                    Wembley on 2 June 2022, Messi assisted twice in a 3–0 victory against Italy and was named player of
                    the match, securing his second trophy for Argentina at the senior level.[479] Messi then followed
                    this on 6 June with all five Argentina goals in a 5–0 victory in a friendly win over Estonia,
                    overtaking Ferenc Puskás among the all-time international men's top scorers.[480]

                    At the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, Messi scored a penalty in Argentina's opening game, a 2–1
                    defeat to Saudi Arabia, before scoring with a low 20-yard strike in their next match against Mexico
                    in which Argentina won 2–0, also recording an assist on Enzo Fernández's goal.[481] In the last 16
                    game against Australia, Messi scored the opening goal in Argentina's 2–1 win in what was his 1,000th
                    senior career appearance,[482] and became the most-capped male South American (CONMEBOL member)
                    footballer of all time, surpassing the previous record set by Ecuador's Iván Hurtado, as well as
                    surpassing and equalling several other FIFA World Cup and national team records.[483][484] In the
                    quarter-final against the Netherlands, Messi assisted Argentina's first goal for Nahuel Molina with
                    a reverse pass and then scored a penalty as the game finished 2–2 after extra time. Argentina won
                    4–3 in the penalty shootout, with Messi scoring the first penalty.[485] In the semi-final against
                    Croatia, Messi made a record-equalling 25th World Cup finals appearance, drawing level with
                    Germany's Lothar Matthäus, and scored the opening goal with a penalty before he assisted Argentina's
                    third goal scored by Julián Álvarez in a 3–0 win;[486] with his 11th World Cup goal, Messi overtook
                    Batistuta to become Argentina's all–time top–scorer at the World Cup.[487] Argentina advanced to the
                    final against France, with Messi stating that it would be his final World Cup appearance.[488][489]

                    In the 2022 FIFA World Cup final on 18 December, Messi made his record 26th World Cup finals
                    appearance at Lusail Stadium. Messi scored Argentina's opening goal with a penalty, becoming in the
                    process the first player since the last-16 round was introduced in 1986 to score a goal in each
                    round of a single World Cup edition.[490] After Argentina's eventual two-goal lead was erased by
                    France forward Kylian Mbappé, who scored twice inside two minutes, Messi would score again in
                    extra-time to restore Argentina's lead, before Mbappé again drew France level. Tied 3–3 after
                    extra-time, the match went to a penalty shoot-out. Messi scored Argentina's first goal in the
                    shoot-out, with Argentina eventually winning 4–2, ending the nation's 36-year wait for the
                    trophy.[491] Messi received the Golden Ball for player of the tournament, becoming the first player
                    to win it twice. He finished second in the Golden Boot race with seven goals in seven games, one
                    behind Mbappé.[490] With his appearance and two goals in the final, Messi overtook Matthaüs as the
                    player with most appearances at the World Cup (26), and Pelé as the player with most direct goal
                    contributions at the World Cup (21 – 13 goals and 8 assists).[492] The championship game was widely
                    acclaimed as one of the best of all time, with media coverage heavily framing it as a duel between
                    Messi and Mbappé.[493][494][495][496] Following the game, Messi confirmed that he had no plans to
                    retire from the national team, saying "I want to continue playing as a champion".[497]
